# Introduction

# Reseach Question

# Relevance
I think there is some formatting error, as you say an attacker needs $2^1 26$ computation steps to solve the easiest version of AES, but that is only 52. That does not seem very secure. You probably wrote `2^126`, but I think you meant `2^{126}`, which would be much more secure.

Apart from that, I agree with the importance of trying to make one of the most used encryption algorithms in use today even more secure.
