# Introduction


# Relevance
I think there is some formatting error, as you say an attacker needs $2^1 26$ computation steps to solve the easiest version of AES, but that is only 52. That does not seem very secure. You probably wrote `2^126`, but I think you meant `2^{126}`, which would be much more secure.

Apart from that, I agree with the importance of trying to make one of the most used encryption algorithms in use today even more secure.

# Theoretical Background

# Method

# General
All in all you need to be more specific. In several cases you say things like

> Ik moet dus zelf eigen functies bedenken, die in een GF(p) berekeningen uitvoeren, waardoor het moeilijke wordt om het te achtervolgen.

What are the actual computations that the function needs to do, and what is "het"?

If you specify your research question and method a bit more, I think this is a great topic of huge interest to almost everybody who uses digital encryption.
