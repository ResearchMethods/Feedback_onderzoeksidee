# Introduction
It is good that you go over what AES is, to give a bit of background for your research idea. I think you need to be a little more specific about the Galois-Fields and functions. You want to define new functions that work on number fields. What are the number fields used for, and what do the functions need to do?

> AES is inmiddels al rond tien jaar het grondprincipe van encrypties online.

Why is AES not used offline?

You say it can be useful to use $GF(p)$, where $p$ is prime. How do you know this? Is that not your research question?

The research question is clear, though it is not clear to me how you want to go about answering it. Maybe you could break it down into smaller subquestion a bit more.

You identify a "possible subquestion". When would this question be relevant? Why is it only a possibility that this question needs to be answered?

# Relevance
I think there is some formatting error, as you say an attacker needs $2^1 26$ computation steps to solve the easiest version of AES, but that is only 52. That does not seem very secure. You probably wrote `2^126`, but I think you meant `2^{126}`, which would be much more secure.

Apart from that, I agree with the importance of trying to make one of the most used encryption algorithms in use today even more secure.

# Theoretical Background

# Method

# General
All in all you need to be more specific. In several cases you say things like

> Ik moet dus zelf eigen functies bedenken, die in een GF(p) berekeningen uitvoeren, waardoor het moeilijke wordt om het te achtervolgen.

What are the actual computations that the function needs to do, and what is "het"?

If you specify your research question and method a bit more, I think this is a great topic of huge interest to almost everybody who uses digital encryption.
